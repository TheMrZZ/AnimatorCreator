Nothing in this folder should be changed.
Those functions are only used to test if the current animator was selected at creation time.
If it is, they will call the {datapackName}:creation/ functions.

If you need to change something, change it in the "creation" folder, not in this one.


----

However, if you want to delete an unused function in this folder, you can.
It will speed up the time needed to load/reload the datapack.
However, never change the content of those functions.
